# 80386 Microprocessor: A Historical Overview
 
The 80386 microprocessor was a 32-bit processor developed by Intel Corporation in the mid-1980s. It was the third generation of the x86 architecture and the first to support a 32-bit address space and virtual memory. The 80386 microprocessor was widely used in personal computers, workstations, servers, and embedded systems until the early 1990s.

The 80386 microprocessor had several features that made it a significant improvement over its predecessors, such as the 8086 and the 80286. Some of these features were:
 
- A 32-bit data bus and a 32-bit address bus, allowing it to access up to 4 GB of physical memory and 64 TB of virtual memory.
- A pipelined architecture that increased the instruction throughput and performance.
- A protected mode that supported multitasking, memory protection, and privilege levels.
- A real mode that was compatible with the 8086 instruction set and allowed it to run legacy software.
- A virtual 8086 mode that enabled it to run multiple real mode programs in protected mode.
- A paging mechanism that enabled it to implement virtual memory and memory management.
- A coprocessor interface that allowed it to communicate with an optional floating-point unit (FPU), such as the 80387.

The 80386 microprocessor was available in several variants, such as the 80386DX, the 80386SX, and the 80386EX. The 80386DX was the original and most powerful version, with a full 32-bit data bus and address bus. The 80386SX was a lower-cost version, with a 16-bit data bus and a 24-bit address bus. The 80386EX was an embedded version, with integrated peripherals and power management features.
 
The 80386 microprocessor was a landmark in the history of computing and paved the way for the development of more advanced processors, such as the 80486 and the Pentium. The 80386 microprocessor also influenced the design of other architectures, such as the ARM and the MIPS. The legacy of the 80386 microprocessor can still be seen today in modern operating systems, software applications, and hardware devices.
  
The 80386 microprocessor was designed to support various operating modes, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Each mode provided unique features and was designed for certain use cases, such as running older applications, advanced memory management, and system management duties. Understanding these operating modes is critical for understanding the 80386 microprocessor's capabilities and limitations, as well as how it was employed in early personal computers and other devices.
 
The 80386 microprocessor supported three main operating modes: real mode, protected mode, and virtual 8086 mode. These modes are briefly described below:

- Real mode: This mode was the default mode of operation when the 80386 microprocessor was powered on or reset. It was also the only mode that was compatible with the 8086 microprocessor. In real mode, the 80386 microprocessor could address only 1 MB of memory using 20-bit addresses. The memory was divided into segments of 64 KB each, and each segment could be accessed by an offset of 16 bits. The real mode did not support any memory protection or multitasking features. It was mainly used to run legacy software that was written for the 8086 microprocessor.
- Protected mode: This mode was the most powerful and flexible mode of operation of the 80386 microprocessor. It enabled the full use of the 32-bit address space and virtual memory features. In protected mode, the 80386 microprocessor could address up to 4 GB of physical memory and 64 TB of virtual memory using 32-bit addresses. The memory was divided into segments of variable size, and each segment could be accessed by a selector of 16 bits. The protected mode supported various memory protection and multitasking features, such as privilege levels, access rights, paging, and exceptions. It was mainly used to run modern software that required more memory and functionality than the real mode could provide.
- Virtual 8086 mode: This mode was a special sub-mode of the protected mode that allowed the 80386 microprocessor to run multiple real mode programs in a protected environment. In virtual 8086 mode, each program had its own virtual machine that emulated a real mode environment with its own memory space and registers. The virtual machines were isolated from each other and from the protected mode by the memory protection features of the protected mode. The virtual 8086 mode supported hardware and software interrupts, as well as some instructions that were not available in real mode. It was mainly used to run legacy software that was written for the 8086 microprocessor without sacrificing the benefits of the protected mode.

The 80386 microprocessor also supported some additional operating modes that were extensions or variations of the main modes. These modes included system management mode (SMM), which allowed the processor to enter a low-power state and perform system management tasks; big real mode (BRM), which allowed the processor to access more than 1 MB of memory in real mode; unreal mode (URM), which allowed the processor to access more than 64 KB of memory per segment in real or virtual 8086 mode; and flat mode (FM), which allowed the processor to access all of its physical memory without segmentation in protected or system management mode.
